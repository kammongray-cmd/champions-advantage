The dashboard looks solid — nice work. Now let's add the killer feature that's missing 
and polish this thing until it shines.

## File & Attachment System (Critical Missing Feature)

The original app has project files, images, and designs attached to each project. 
This is essential for a sign shop — every project IS its visuals.

Build a complete file management system:

### Per-Project Attachments
- Upload multiple files per project (drag & drop + click to upload)
- Support images (JPG, PNG, WebP), PDFs, and design files
- Auto-generate thumbnails for images
- File categories: "Design Mockup", "Customer Photo", "Proposal", "Production File", "Permit", "Other"
- Each file shows: thumbnail, filename, category tag, upload date, file size
- Click to preview (lightbox for images, inline for PDFs)
- Delete with confirmation

### Google Drive Integration
- Link a Google Drive folder to any project
- Show Drive folder contents inline in the project view
- Quick-link button to open the Drive folder in a new tab

### Project Detail — Make It Beautiful
- Hero section with the latest design mockup as a banner image
- Photo gallery grid of all project images (masonry or grid layout)
- Before/after comparison view (customer photo vs design mockup)
- File section organized by category with icons
- Timeline view showing project history (calls, emails, status changes, file uploads)

### API Endpoints
- GET /api/projects/:id/attachments — list all files
- POST /api/projects/:id/attachments — upload file (multipart)
- DELETE /api/projects/:id/attachments/:fileId — remove file
- PUT /api/projects/:id/attachments/:fileId — update category/metadata
- GET /api/projects/:id/drive — linked Drive folder info

## Overall Polish Pass

While you're in there, surprise me:
- Smooth transitions and animations (subtle, professional — not flashy)
- Toast notifications for actions (saved, uploaded, deleted)
- Loading skeletons instead of spinners
- Keyboard shortcuts (N for new project, / for search)
- Pipeline cards that feel alive — drag to move between stages if possible
- The dashboard should make me WANT to open this app every morning
- Mobile experience should feel native — swipe gestures, bottom sheet modals
- Dark mode should be gorgeous, not just "dark gray on darker gray"
- Add a quick-search spotlight (Cmd+K style) to find any project or lead instantly

Think of this as the app I'm going to show potential clients. 
First impressions matter. Make it feel like a $10,000 custom build.
