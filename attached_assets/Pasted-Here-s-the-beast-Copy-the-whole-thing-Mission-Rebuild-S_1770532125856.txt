## Mission: Rebuild Sign Shop Suite as React + Express/TypeScript

You are rebuilding a Streamlit/Python CRM app into a modern React + Express/TypeScript application. This is a full rewrite — new stack, same functionality, better architecture.

### ⚠️ DATABASE SAFETY — READ THIS FIRST
DO NOT connect to the live Supabase database during development.
Use Replit's built-in PostgreSQL database for all building and testing.

Steps:
1. Read the existing Streamlit codebase to understand the current schema
2. Recreate the same schema in Replit's local PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM migrations
3. Seed it with sample/test data so we can verify everything works
4. We will connect to the live Supabase database LATER, only after everything is tested

Remove or ignore the SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, and DATABASE_URL secrets for now.
Use Replit's built-in database connection instead.

### Step 1: Study the Existing App
Before writing any code, read and understand:
- All Python files, especially app.py, main.py, and everything in /views/
- The database schema — every table, column, and relationship
- The /services/ directory for AI integrations
- The /api/lead_receiver.py webhook
- The /components/ directory for UI patterns
- Document what you find before building

### Step 2: Architecture (match my SalesRecall project exactly)
Reference repo: github.com/kammongray-cmd/SalesRecall

Structure:
```
/server/
  routes.ts        — ALL API routes
  storage.ts       — database access layer
  db.ts            — Drizzle ORM connection
/client/
  /src/
    /pages/        — React page components
    /components/   — Reusable UI components
    /hooks/        — Custom React hooks
    /lib/          — Utilities
/shared/
  schema.ts        — Drizzle schema + shared types
drizzle.config.ts  — Drizzle configuration
```

Tech stack:
- Express server with TypeScript
- Drizzle ORM for database (PostgreSQL)
- React client with TypeScript
- Shared types between client and server
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

### Step 3: Features to Preserve (ALL must work)
1. **Dashboard** with 5-block pipeline: Next Action (0) → Survey (A) → Design (B) → Proposal (C) → Production (D)
2. **Project Detail view** — full project info, status, history, attachments, notes
3. **Lead Detail view** — lead info, qualification, conversion to project
4. **Ledger** / financial tracking
5. **Lead receiver webhook** — currently api/lead_receiver.py → rebuild as POST /api/leads (Google Chat integration)
6. **Production Lockdown** — prevents version errors in production stage
7. **AI integrations** — Gemini for summaries, analysis, or any existing AI features
8. **Email functionality** — SMTP integration for sending emails/notifications
9. **Project history tracking** — phone calls, emails, notes, status changes
10. **Multi-tenant support** — preserve the tenant_id pattern if it exists in the schema

### Step 4: REST API (this is critical)
Every piece of data MUST be accessible via REST endpoints. This is what allows external tools to connect.

Required endpoints:
- `GET /api/projects` — list all projects (with filters: status, pipeline stage, search)
- `GET /api/projects/:id` — single project with full detail
- `POST /api/projects` — create project
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` — update project
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` — soft delete only (never hard delete)
- `GET /api/leads` — list leads
- `GET /api/leads/:id` — lead detail
- `POST /api/leads` — create lead / webhook receiver for Google Chat
- `PUT /api/leads/:id` — update lead
- `POST /api/leads/:id/convert` — convert lead to project
- `GET /api/pipeline` — current pipeline status (counts per stage)
- `GET /api/daily-summary` — today's actionable items
- `GET /api/contacts` — all contacts
- `GET /api/ledger` — financial entries
- `POST /api/ledger` — add entry
- All endpoints return JSON
- All list endpoints support search/filter query params

### Step 5: UI Design
- Clean dark professional theme (similar to SalesRecall's orange/dark style)
- Bottom navigation bar for mobile (Home, Projects, Leads, Ledger, Settings)
- Pipeline visualized as 5 columns or cards on dashboard
- Responsive — works great on phone and desktop
- Settings page for configuration
- Quick actions: tap to call, tap to email from contact cards

### Step 6: Build Order (follow this sequence)
1. **Schema first** — Drizzle schema matching existing database structure
2. **Database connection** — verify Replit PostgreSQL works
3. **Migrations** — create all tables, seed with test data
4. **API routes** — build and test every endpoint
5. **React app scaffold** — routing, layout, navigation
6. **Dashboard page** — pipeline view with real data
7. **Project detail page** — full CRUD
8. **Lead pages** — list, detail, conversion
9. **Ledger page** — financial tracking
10. **Settings page** — configuration
11. **Webhook** — POST /api/leads for Google Chat
12. **AI features** — Gemini integration for any existing AI features
13. **Email** — SMTP send capability
14. **Polish** — mobile responsive, dark theme, loading states

### Rules
- DO NOT skip features from the original app
- DO NOT use placeholder/mock data in the final build — connect to real DB
- DO NOT hard delete anything — soft deletes only
- DO build incrementally and test each layer before moving to the next
- DO keep the code clean and typed — no `any` types
- DO handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- DO make the API documentation clear in the code with comments
```
